## Introduction

(1-2 paragraphs) Brief introduction to the dataset. You may repeat some
of the information about the dataset provided in the introduction to the
dataset on the TidyTuesday repository, paraphrasing on your own terms.
Imagine that your project is a standalone document and the grader has no
prior knowledge of the dataset.

## Question 1 \<- Update title to relate to the question you’re answering

### Introduction

(1-2 paragraphs) Introduction to the question and what parts of the
dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re
interested in this question.

### Approach

(1-2 paragraphs) Describe what types of plots you are going to make to
address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to
why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for
providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be
of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use
either color mapping or facets.

### Analysis

(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed) In this
section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions
to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme
functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not
required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base
R or lattice plotting functions.

### Discussion

(1-3 paragraphs) In the Discussion section, interpret the results of
your analysis. Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the
plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.
